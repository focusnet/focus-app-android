FOCUS Android application

(still in active development ... may not compile at all)

## Warning

The application silently sends error reports when it encounters errors. These reports may contain
the content of the displayed dashboards and other sensitive information. If you do not agree
with that, please do not use the application

This feature will be disabled when the application enters production stage.

## DEV note

we use git sumbodules for fi.simosol.focus.map. Be careful, submodules are not easy not handle.
